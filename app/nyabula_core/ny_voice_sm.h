 * The voice turn as a pure transition function.
 *
 *   OFF -> IDLE -> LISTENING -> THINKING -> SPEAKING -> IDLE
 *
 * ny_voice_sm_step() takes the machine, one event and the time, and returns
 * the next state plus an ordered list of actions for ny_voice.c to carry
 * out.  It touches no device, no lock and no clock, so a scripted event
 * list on the host exercises every path, including the ones a board makes
 * hard to reach: a compute domain that restarts in the middle of a turn, an
 * ASR request whose FINISH never comes, a wake word on top of a reply.
 *
 * The machine does not hold text.  The transcript and the reply belong to
 * the service; the machine only needs to know whether they are empty.
