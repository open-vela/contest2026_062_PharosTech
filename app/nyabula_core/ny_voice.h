 * The control-domain half of the voice assistant.
 *
 *   "ni hao openvela" -> listen -> transcribe -> agent -> speak
 *
 * The compute domain runs the models (wake word, ASR, TTS; see
 * tools/amp/nyampd); this side owns the microphone, the speaker, the turn
 * and the owner's agent:
 *
 *   ny_voice_capture  the microphone: S16 into a 4 s pre-roll ring, an
 *                     energy gate so that silence is not streamed for ever
 *   ny_voice_pump     ring -> CAPTURE-slot windows -> KWS_PUSH, DETECTED
 *   ny_voice_sm       the turn (ny_voice_sm.c), ASR attached to the wake
 *                     word stream, the agent run, model loading
 *   ny_voice_play     TTS sentence by sentence, PCM windows to the speaker
 *   ny_voice_eyes     expression requests: eyes.expression is a confirmed
 *                     call of up to a second and must never run on a thread
 *                     that moves audio
 *
 * The topic entry point (voice.*) is declared in ny_product.h with the other
 * topic handlers.

 * Name: ny_voice_speaker_claim / ny_voice_speaker_release
 *
 * Description:
 *   For the other users of the codec.  The ES8388 driver refuses a playback
 *   format that differs from the capture format while the microphone is
 *   reserved, so whoever is about to open the speaker in a format of its
 *   own (the flash player, Bluetooth audio) calls claim first: the
 *   microphone is closed before claim returns, the wake word is deaf until
 *   release.  Both are cheap when voice is disabled or not running, and
 *   claim is not needed at all in the NYABULA_CORE_VOICE_CODEC_SHARED_44K
 *   arrangement as long as the other stream is 44.1 kHz stereo.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   claim: zero, or -ETIMEDOUT when the microphone did not close in time.
