/****************************************************************************
 * The control domain's client for the speech services of the compute
 * domain: ASR (3), TTS (4) and KWS (10) of tools/amp/protocol.
 *
 * One ny_voice_wire_s is one conversation with one service.  It sends
 * through callbacks rather than through a descriptor, because there are
 * three ways to reach the peer and the sequences must be the same on all of
 * them: a port of the Core compute service (ny_voice.c, and nyampctl while
 * that service runs), the RPMsg endpoint itself (nyampctl standalone), and a
 * socket pair to nyampd's real services on the host (the wire test).
 *
 * A port delivers only the frames of the request it last sent, and every
 * message of one speech request shares the BEGIN's request id, so one
 * conversation needs exactly one port.  Events that arrive while a response
 * is awaited -- a DETECTED between a PUSH and its acknowledgement -- are
 * kept and handed out by ny_voice_wire_event() in order.
 *
 * Nothing here includes a NuttX header.
