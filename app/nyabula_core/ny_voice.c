/****************************************************************************
 * The voice service.  Who does what is in ny_voice.h; this is WHY it is
 * arranged the way it is.
 *
 * One codec, one clock.  The ES8388 driver refuses to configure one
 * direction in a rate, width or channel count other than the one the other
 * direction is reserved in (es8388_check_peer_format).  The microphone wants
 * 16 kHz mono, the speaker gets 44.1 kHz from the TTS model and from every
 * other player in the product.  Three arrangements are offered:
 *
 *   HALF        (default) the microphone is closed while the robot speaks.
 *               It is the only one built on what has been measured on the
 *               board (16 kHz mono capture, 44.1 kHz playback), and it needs
 *               no echo handling: the robot cannot wake itself.  Barge-in is
 *               then the panel's voice.listen / voice.cancel, not the voice.
 *   SHARED_16K  speech is resampled to 16 kHz mono, so both directions run
 *               in the capture format and the microphone stays open.
 *   SHARED_44K  the microphone runs in the speaker's format (44.1 kHz
 *               stereo) and is decimated to 16 kHz here, so the flash
 *               player, the alarm chime and Bluetooth music coexist with
 *               the wake word without any arbitration.
 *
 * In HALF and SHARED_16K another player that opens the speaker in its own
 * format fails with -EBUSY for as long as the microphone is open; it has to
 * call ny_voice_speaker_claim() first, as the flash player already does for
 * Bluetooth.
 *
 * Echo.  There is no echo canceller.  While the robot speaks the microphone
 * is not streamed to the wake word service -- always in HALF, and in the
 * SHARED arrangements unless NYABULA_CORE_VOICE_BARGE_IN says the owner
 * prefers interrupting by voice to the risk of a false wake; even then a
 * reply that itself contains the wake word is spoken deaf.
 *
 * The owner.  A voice turn is submitted to the agent as the owner, because
 * the robot has one owner and no way (yet) to tell voices apart.  What keeps
 * that safe is the agent's own rule: an action with side effects waits for
 * an approval given on the panel, and this service only ever ASKS for it.
 *
 * Threads never share a compute port: a port delivers the frames of the
 * request it last sent, and every message of one speech request carries the
 * BEGIN's id, so KWS belongs to the pump, ASR to the turn thread and TTS to
 * the player.
 *
