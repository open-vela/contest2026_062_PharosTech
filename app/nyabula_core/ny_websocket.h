 * scratch buffer exactly as received, NUL-terminated.

 * The read that completed the head may also have taken the start of a

 * there are, and they sit immediately after the head's terminator, at
 * scratch + strlen(scratch) + 1.  The rest of the body is still unread on
 * the socket.  body may be NULL when the caller serves no method with one.
