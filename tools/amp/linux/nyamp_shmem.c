 * nyamp_shmem.c - Nyabula AMP shared-memory region (Linux compute domain)
 *
 * The control domain and the compute domain exchange audio through a reserved
 * region instead of through RPMsg messages.  A second of 16 kHz float32 PCM is
 * 64 KiB and the TTS vocoder emits 1 MiB in one call, so carrying those as
 * RPMsg chunks would take hundreds of round trips; the messages carry only a
 * descriptor and the bytes live here.
 *
 * This driver does one thing: it maps the reserved region into userspace and
 * reports its geometry.  Placement, ownership and lifetime are the daemon's
 * policy, kept out of the kernel so it can be tested without a board.
 *
 * The region is already reserved by the device tree with no-map, which keeps
 * it out of the linear mapping and out of the page allocator.  no-map does not
 * prevent ioremap, and the vendor rpmsg driver maps its vrings the same way.
 * The mapping is non-cacheable, matching the control domain's mapping of the
 * same pages: one physical page shared under two cacheabilities is undefined
 * behaviour, and it would show up as an occasional stale sample rather than a
 * clean failure.
